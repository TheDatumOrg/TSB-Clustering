Implementation of the KSC and IncrementalKSC algorithms.  See [1] for details.
Both algorithms can be used for clustering time series data, the second
(IncrementalKSC) being an optimization of the initial clusters heuristic to
be used by the first.

def _base_ksc(tseries, initial_centroids, n_iters=-1):
    '''
    This is the base of the KSC algorithm. It follows the same idea of a K-Means
    algorithm. Firstly, we assign time series to a new cluster based on the
    distance to the centroids. For each time series, it is computed the best
    shift to minimize the distance to the closest centroid.
     
    The assignment step is followed by an update step where new centroids are 
    computed based on the new clustering (based on the update step).
    
    Both steps above are repeated `n_iters` times. If this parameter is negative
    then the steps are repeated until convergence, that is, until no time series
    changes cluster between consecutive steps.

    ---------
    tseries: a matrix of shape (number of time series, size of each series)
        The time series to cluster
    initial_centroids: a matrix of shape (num. of clusters, size of time series)
        The initial centroid estimates
    n_iters: int

    -------
    centroids: a matrix of shape (num. of clusters, size of time series)

    Discrete Harr Wavelet Transforms of the time series to be clustered. At
    each transform the number of points of the time series is decreased, thus
    we say that we are viewing the time series at a higher resolution. 
    
    Clustering will begin at the highest resolution (last transform), and the
    results from the previous resolution is used to initialized the current one.
    Only the highest resolution is initialized randomly. This technique can 
    improve the run-time of the KSC algorithm, since it is faster to cluster 
    at higher resolutions (less data points), being for subsequent resolutions
    the centroids from the previous resolution already a close approximation of
    the actual centroid. See [1] for details.
